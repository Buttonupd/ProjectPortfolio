                    <li>
                        I am truly humbled by this opportunity to experience front-end programming with such adept and knowledgeable technical mentors such as your selves.<br>
                        Although that was not about me, it shall be reflected as me being modeled by you, we appreaciate you.</li>
                    <li>Currently, a masters in cyber security is two years away, so I have decided to be two years ahead of myself</li>
                    <li>Governance and security repletes my educational background, in an institution of higher learning.<br>However, as a systems analyst, using both conventional, and a little bit of unconventional methodologies, acquiring skills in front-end programming is definitely important</li>
